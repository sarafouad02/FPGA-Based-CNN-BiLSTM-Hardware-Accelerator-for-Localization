# FPGA-Based-CNN-BiLSTM-Hardware-Accelerator-for-Localization
This repository includes the CNN accelerator for a low‑power FPGA accelerator that fuses monocular‑camera visual features and IMU motion data—via a CNN and a bidirectional LSTM network—to produce 3D vehicle position estimates in GPS‑denied environments (e.g., parking garages). Fully implemented at RTL with fixed‑point arithmetic,
